For this assignment I am designing and creating a page that highlights the fighting games and the communities revolving them.
I will go over my personal view on these type of games and give a basic introduction to these games,
such as how to choose which game to play and what type of controllers there are.
Then I will go and show some highlights of the interesting communities that surround 
these games and maybe give some needed context along the way.

Development Notes #1 - Large focus on html side at first as it is content heavy, expecially with words. 
Doing minimal styling(aligning elements and making them uniform)

Development Notes #2 - Put images inside a flexbox for a more responsive design

Development Notes #3 - Was going to put the video sections in a flexbox(thats why they are in div elements and have unused classes)
but didnt implement the flexbox because the flow scrolling down the page made more sense.

Development Notes #4 - Making feedback page, forms are there for visuals since I do not have an e-mail client implemented, 
changed input text to textarea.

Final thoughts for this project - I originally wanted to do more with the structure and styling but there was a lot of content 
and information I wanted to go over, and because of the nature of how much reading is involved the manual style 
I ended up going for made more sense. If I had more time to work on this I would try to flesh out the different areas and 
elements more so they are more uniform and implement more animations and try to get more fluidity in the page.
