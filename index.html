                <h2>
                    Why Fighting Games?
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraphintro">Unlike other player-versus-player (PVP) games, fighting games are often one player versus one player. This cultivates an environment where players are forced to improve their abilities if they wish to improve and win more games. Regular local meets for these fighting games are also common place in areas where these communities are present, often called offline casuals, this is a fresh space in an era where multiplayer games are mainly online. These, alongside official tournaments are the backbone of fighting games.</p>

                    While there are similiraties across different fighting games, each game plays and feels differently, so players will need to consider which game they would actually want to play. A beginner, however, would know nothing about these things, so my suggestions to anyone getting into fighting games for the first times would be to choose whichever one looks the coolest to you. My personal favourites are the Tekken games, with Street Fighter coming in a close second. I like Tekken because it looks and feels good to me, I enjoy both playing and watching the game.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here is a list of other games to consider:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/" target=”_blank”><u></u>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</u></a> - The latest entry in the Smash Bros. series. While traditionally considered a "brawler" style game, featuring multiplayer free-for-all style battles, the game's 1v1 competitive scene is very much alive and thriving (notorious in the fighting game scene for their player's body odour).</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.mortalkombat.com/en-us" target=”_blank”><u></u>Mortal Kombat 1</u></a> - Not to be confused with the series' original release, Mortal Kombat 1 is the latest entry in the Mortal Kombat series, I personally don't know much about the game but I do know the series is one of the best-selling fighting games around, so it definitely has a very active community to participate in.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/" target=”_blank”><u>Guilty Gear Strive</u></a> - The latest entry in the Guilty Gear series, a series of games that falls under the "anime-fighter" subset of fighting games. While I personally do not know much about these games, I know that this particular entry is highly praised for it's amazing visual work, utilizing 3D models with cell-shading and lower frames to achieve a unique and visually pleasing art style.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz" target=”_blank”><u>Dragon Ball FighterZ</u></a> - Another game that falls under the "anime-fighter" subset, this game was developed by the same developers who did Guilty Gear Strive, and retains the same rendering and animation style. This, along with a robust combat system and Dragon Ball's established popularity made this game a big hit when it came out and is still one of the most played fighting games to date, with a sequel set to come out soon.</li>
                </ul>

                    Fighting games come from the era of arcade cabinets where these games were played with arcade controls, nowadays these games are played on different consoles or even computers, this gives players options to different controllers to play these games.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Here is a table listing different types of controllers, their layout, and product recommendations for each type.</p>

                        <td>Similar form factor to a fightstick, but instead of a lever for movement, it is replaced by 4 buttons used for movement, allowing for faster inputs and can help prevent injury from constant lever/joystick use.</td>

                <h2>The Glorious FGC</h2>
                <p>The nature of the competitive scenes of these games being in person and face-to-face, has helped build the Fighting Game Community (or FGC for short) to what it is today. It is a community that brings people together through competetion, comradary, and joy through shared moments. In this section I will highlight some of my favourite moments in the community.</p>

                        <p>Watching the pros in action is one of the cornerstones of what makes fighting games enjoyable, and one of the most historic moments in fighting games is the "Daigo Parry" from a Street Fighter match in EVO 2004. Daigo, who was hanging on by sliver of health performed a frame-perfect multi-input parry to steal the win.</p>

                        <h3>Salt</h3>
                        <p>Salt as most people know it is a table condiment. In competitive fighting games however, salt is the mental effect placed upon a frustrated player, often times one who is losing badly. Salt often causes players to act out in volatile and intriguing ways. This video will showcase some of the effects of salt.</p>

                        <p>Through all the competition, trash talking, and <i>salt</i>, is a culture and environment that tries its best to bring people together through healthy competition, newfound friendships, and hype moments. Here is a video that shows my favourite moments in the FGC.</p>
